<h1>Chicken Tortellini with Tomatoes</h1>
<img src="../images/tortellini.jpeg" alt="Tortellini">
<p>This is a "sauceless" Tortellini pasta dish. It only has a few ingredients and
    is incredibly easy to make. 

    My wife and I make it on the week days where neither of us want to cook. If you're
    feeling particularly lazy (like we do) you can use a disposable pan to only have
    one or two dishes to wash once you're done.
